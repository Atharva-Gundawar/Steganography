Implimenting Steganography (Hidding text and images inside an image)

## About Steganography

Steganography is the art of hiding a message inside another message. In this case we will hide a text message inside an image. An image will most propably go unnotified, not a bunch of people will suspect a message hidden inside an image. Steganography is no means of encryption, just a way of hiding data inside an image.
